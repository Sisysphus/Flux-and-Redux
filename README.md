What is Flux?
</h1>

Flux is a front-end application architecture Facebook developed to use with React.

Flux is not a library or framework.

Flux is simple a pattern in which to structure one's application.

It doesnt even need to be used with React!

Flux provides unidirectional data flow.

Unidirectional data flow affords more predictability than one might encounter when using other applications design patterns.

An action begins the flow of data in Flux. An action is a simple object that at a minimum contains a type.

An actions type indicates the type if change to be performed on the application's state.

An action may contain additional data (the "payload") that's necessary for changing the applications former state to the next one.
